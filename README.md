# PSD to HTML with React

This is a project that demonstrates the conversion of a PSD (Photoshop) design file into a fully functional website using React. The goal of this project is to showcase my skill og converting a static design into dynamic web pages using React components.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **PSD Design**: Start with a PSD design file that represents the desired look and layout of the website.
2. **Slice PSD**: Break down the PSD design into smaller components (such as headers, footers, navigation bars, etc.) to make it easier to implement and manage.
3. **HTML/CSS**: Convert the sliced components into HTML and CSS code, ensuring that the layout and styling match the design.
4. **React Components**: Create React components for each sliced component, making them reusable and modular.
5. **Responsive Design**: Implement responsive design principles to ensure the website looks good and functions well across different devices and screen sizes, Though I haven't made it responsive hehe.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML: Markup language used for structuring the web page content.
- CSS: Styling language used for designing the website's appearance.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for interactivity and functionality.
- PSD Editing Software: Adobe Photoshop for slicing the PSD file.
